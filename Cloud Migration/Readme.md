### Cloud Migration with AWS VM Import/Export

In the Cloud Migration project, I achieved a seamless transition of on-premise VirtualBox VMs to AWS EC2 through the strategic use of the VM Import/Export feature. The project is meticulously structured, featuring organized scripts and insightful diagrams to enhance user accessibility.

The achievement includes a step-by-step migration process where I effectively halted the VirtualBox VM, exported it to an OVA file, and securely uploaded it to an S3 bucket. The establishment of a robust IAM role for VM Import/Export, combined with the smooth import of the OVA file as an EC2 AMI, resulted in the efficient provisioning of a new EC2 instance.

The project's documentation is comprehensive, with the README file offering clear instructions for users. Visual insights are provided through diagrams like the VM Import/Export Process and AWS EC2 Deployment, enhancing the overall understanding of the migration process.

Resource management was a key focus, demonstrating proficiency in cloud migration strategies. The successful provisioning of a new EC2 instance highlighted effective resource utilization.

To ensure adaptability for future use cases, adaptable scripts are provided in the "scripts" directory. Furthermore, a detailed_instructions.md file in the documentation folder offers in-depth insights into the project, contributing to its overall completeness.
